                <h4><span class="CYK"></span> The Entity Object</span></h4>
                Entities are objects replacing CYF's usual Monster scripts. They can be used much like them, except some things have been added,
                and others have been changed.
                <br><br>
                Entity objects can also be used for Players, as Create Your Kris allows you to manage your own Player team.
                <br><br>
                We will now see what variables Player objects and enemy objects have in common, then we'll glance at the differences between the
                two types of Entity objects.
                <br><br>
                <h4 style="line-height:30px;">Note: You can find other variables and functions usable in these scripts in <span class="ref">Special Variables</span>.</h4>
            </p>

            <h4>Variables and functions used by Players and enemies.</h4><br>

            <p>
                <span class="function"><span class="string"></span> <span class="term">name</span></span>
                Name of the entity. Is automatically created using the script's name.
                <br><br>
                If used on a Player, its name shown in the Player UI won't be modified accordingly. To update it, you must use the
                function <span class="term">UpdateUI()</span> (see <span class="ref">Player-specific variables and functions</span>).
                <br><br>
                * Should not be modified for monster scripts.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <span class="function"><span class="entity"></span> <span class="term">self</span></span>
                The entity itself.
                <br><br>
                It allows the user to spare themselves from searching through the entity tables in the Encounter when referencing this entity.
                <br><br>
                Example: If you want to call <span class="term">Hurt(damage, from)</span>, the second argument is an entity file.
                Pass <span class="term">self</span> as the second argument to easily reference the current script.
                <br><br>
                * Should not be modified.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <span class="function"><span class="number"></span> <span class="term">posX</span></span>
				X position of the entity used by CYK to run animations on the entity, such as the shaking animation
                when this entity is being damaged.
                <br><br>
                * Shouldn't be changed manually, use <span class="term">Move()</span>, <span class="term">
                MoveTo()</span> or <span class="term">MoveToAbs()</span> instead.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <span class="function"><span class="number"></span> <span class="term">posY</span></span>
				Y position of the entity used by CYK to run animations on the entity, such as the shaking animation
                when this entity is being damaged.
                <br><br>
                * Shouldn't be changed manually, use <span class="term">Move()</span>, <span class="term">
                MoveTo()</span> or <span class="term">MoveToAbs()</span> instead.

                table <span class="term">players</span>, and if it is an enemy, it'll be its index in the table <span class="term">enemies</span>.

                <span class="term">self</span> is the current entity script, so it will hurt itself.
