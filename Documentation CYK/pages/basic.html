            <h2>Understanding your Files and Directories</h2><br><br>

            <p>Create Your Kris specializes in developing brief to long Deltarune-esque battles. As such, it may not be the most ideal 
                engine for developing mods that go beyond that. Regardless, it's got some allure to it: It's easy to and straigthforward
                to work with, and you can quickly get started on mods, even with minimal Lua knowledge. Just make sure to look
                up how to work with Lua's or CYK's syntax as you go on.<br><br>
                First off, we'll start with a quick overview of the scripts you'll be primarily working with:
                <ul>
                    <li><u>Monster files</u>: will contain information about your enemies, but the term "Monster" is most recurrent within the engine.
                        Here, you'll set their stats, flavor text, dialogues shown via speech bubbles, sprite animations, and ACT behaviour.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><span class="CYK"></span> <u>Player files</u>: will contain information about your players. Here, you'll set things 
                        like their stats, sprite animations, spells and other sorts of custom behaviour.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><u>Encounter scripts</u>: The +Overworld library doesn't support multiple Encounter files. Ideally, you'll only
                        ever need one. Adding more probably won't get you what you're looking for.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><span class="OW"></span> <u>Battle scripts</u>: will contain the involved monsters, players, wave scripts (which you can modify at
                        any point) and other behaviour that pertains that encounter in particular.<br>
                        Whenever the term <b>Encounter</b> is thrown around, assume it's addressing <i>these</i> files instead.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><u>Wave scripts</u>: Empirically known as the scripts that control those white bullets which spawn during the defending phase of the game.
                    </li><br>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Files and directories</h3><br>

            <p>
                Whenever you're passing down a file as an argument to a function, say, <span class="term">CreateSprite()</span>, <span class="term">Audio.LoadFile()</span>
                or an <b>include</b> statement, you mustn't add the file's extention. This is done for you by the engine.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h4>Scripts</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Battle, Monster, Player and Wave</b> scripts are only loaded from within their respective <span class="term">Lua/</span> folders.
                <br><br>
                <span class="CYK"></span> <span class="term">YOUR MOD/Lua/Libraries</span> comes with a folder named <span class="term">CYK</span> included.<br>
                
                <font style="color:#fff;text-decoration:underline">DO NOT DELETE ANYTHING IN THIS FOLDER!</font><br>
                It is required for CYK's functionality. You're free to modify the library, for further enhanced or particular functionality to your mod.
                However, you ideally shouldn't need to.<br>
                You can find a tutorial on Lua libraries/modules 
                <a href="http://lua-users.org/wiki/ModulesTutorial">here</a>.
            </p><br>

            <h4>Audio Files</h4>
            <p>
                Only the .wav and .ogg formats are supported.<br>
                <b>Sound</b> effects must be located within their respective folder. <b>Voice</b> sound effects (those brief sputtering noises that 
                play while the text is being shown) must be located within <span class="term">Sounds/Voices/</span>.<br>
                <b>Song/Music</b> files, on the other hand, are solely located inside <span class="term">Audio/</span>.
            </p><br>

            <h4>Sprite files</h4>
            
            <p>
                <p>They must be in the .png format, and will only load from their respective folder.<br>
                    Most of these sprites are manually scaled by 2 in order be adequately used. You may use a tool such as IrfanViewer
                    to batch resize your files. Be careful handling it, though.
                </p><br>

                <span class="CYK"></span> Sprites for Players/Monsters must be located within <span class="term">Sprites/CreateYourKris/</span>.<br>
                <br>

                <p>
                    There is no spritesheet support in this engine, so every animation needs a separate folder containing all involved sprite frames.
                    <br>
                    For example, if you want to add sprites for the animation "Idle" for the Player "Kris",
                    you'll put all your individual frames inside the folder <span class="term">YOURMOD/CreateYourKris/Players/Kris/Idle</span>.
                </p>
            </p>
